## Angular tests

I create this project to study tests using Karma and Jasmine with Angular framework. 
Basically I created a service called uniqueid that generate unique ids and expect a prefix to do this. 

## Running the project

First, clone this repository then inside the project folder run `npm i` to install all of dependencies.
You can run de application using `ng serve`, but, I don't change the home screen it's default.
To run the tests use `ng test`.
